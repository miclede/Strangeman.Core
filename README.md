# Strangeman.Utils
[![ChangelogBadge]](CHANGELOG.md) [![GitHub package.json version]][ReleasesLink] [![InstallationBadge]](#installation)


This package primarily provides dependencies to the Strangeman helper packages.

The package will be updated as I cleanup my design pattern implementations, develop future extensions and document them for future product development.

Feel free to browse the online documentation (under development 2024.7.6) and create your own projects using this as a resource. While it is not required to state that a product / project is using this repo, I would like to shout-out those that do.

## Installation
Add to Unity from Package Manager:
```
https://github.com/miclede/Strangeman.Utils.git
```

From manifest.json:
```
"com.strangeman.utils": "https://github.com/miclede/Strangeman.Utils.git"
