# Strangeman.Utils

This package primarily provides dependencies to the Strangeman helper packages.

The package will be updated as I cleanup my design pattern implementations and document them for future product development.

Feel free to browse the online documentation (found under the package.json) and create your own projects using this as a resource. While it is not required to state that a product / project is using this repo, I would like to shout-out those that do.
